# Reporting Security Issues

Please report any security issues you discovered in the bot to chauve.richard@protonmail.com

We will assess the risk, plus make a fix available before we create a GitHub issue.

In case the vulnerability is into another asset, do not report this to us but refer to the applicable security policy.

Thank you for your contribution.
